# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O


## Learning Objectives

### General

- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Big O Asinthotic notation in time complexity

### Format used for O notation

- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n!)
- n square -> O(n^2)
- log(n) -> O(log(n))
- n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
- n + k -> O(n+k)

The “short” notation (don’t use constants). Example: O(nk) or O(wn) will be written O(n).

### About O files

In each line will contain the following big O notation about time complexity

- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case

## Environment


- Language: C

- Compiler: gcc 9.3.0
  - flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`

- Compilation: to compile all the algorithms use `./compile_all.sh` with sudo privileges
